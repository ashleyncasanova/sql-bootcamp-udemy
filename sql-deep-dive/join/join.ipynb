    "1. **Inner JOIN:**\n",
    "   - Retrieves rows where there is a match in both tables based on the specified condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Outer JOIN:**\n",
    "   - Retrieves all rows from one table and the matching rows from another table, including non-matching rows with NULL values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Left (or Right) JOIN:**\n",
    "   - Retrieves all rows from the left (or right) table and the matching rows from the right (or left) table, including non-matching rows with NULL values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Self JOIN:**\n",
    "   - Joins a table with itself, typically used when establishing relationships within the same table.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Cross JOIN:**\n",
    "   - Produces the Cartesian product of two tables, resulting in all possible combinations of rows.\n",

    "**Common Usage:**\n",
    "- Multi-table SELECT statements, where data needs to be aggregated or retrieved from multiple sources.\n",
